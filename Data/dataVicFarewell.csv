Chris Lee,"Thanks Victor for all your help from the various finance questions, MSDB, SDFD to broad general life / civil service advice. You’ve been great to work with in MSO, and you’ve been extremely patient with everyone of us. Not really a farewell since you’re still part of MND, though now on the other side. All the best with MND finance and I hope you enjoy your time there! And hopefully we don’t have to bug you too much on finance questions next time. But no promises :)",103.7560588,1.422873002

Leanne,"Hi Victor, I'm not gonna lie, I am sad to *see* (virtually) you leave MSO, especially after all the guidance you have given me this past 5 months. I really appreciate your patience and your warmth in going through all the gory MSDB details and duties with me, especially in this difficult time of communicating via screens. I also appreciate all the non-work conversations we had, about learning and development, finance, and ~~dash-boarding~~. Hope you still manage to find some time to play with Tableau/QlikSense/PowerBI once in a while. Though I am sad to see you leave, I know you will be off to greener pastures indeed -- you seem to be in the deep end already, but seeing how you handled all the finance and budgets of MSDB, I know you'll manage well. Wishing you all the best in your future endeavours and hope we can still keep in touch!",103.8469401,1.417741209
